# Fidget PCB!
(Submission for Hack Club: Pathfinder, Highway, Athena Award)

4 key, 4 LED controller board. 
Pressing one key will turn LEDs on one by one. 
Pressing a different key will cycle through the buttons, turning off the previous LED as it cycles.
After a 1 second delay, pressing the third key will convey "HELLO WORLD" through flashing Morse Code!
The fourth key will only turn on its corresponding LED if pressed quickly after the third key is pressed.
